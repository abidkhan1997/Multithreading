The Department of Computer Science offers undergraduate majors in Computer Science 
as part of Bachelor of Science (BS) and Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree programs. The BS 
augments the BA with more computer science, mathematics, and experimental laboratory courses. 
In addition, the Department offers four undergraduate minors in Computer Science, Computer 
Information Technology (CIT), Computational Linguistics, and Financial Modeling. This page 
contains information about each of these options. 
For students not majoring or minoring in Computer Science, CSCI 12 provides an understanding of 
how problems are formulated for solution by a personal computer using popular software packages. 
CSCI 111 teaches introductory programming for students who have never used a computer, and serves as 
a first course for students considering a major or minor in computer science. See the Courses and 
Schedule page for more details about these courses. 
The Department of Computer Science offers a Master of Arts (MA) degree in Computer Science. 
The PhD Program in Computer Science is based at the CUNY Graduate Center and is offered in collaboration  
with other CUNY colleges. PhD students may be advised by and conduct research with faculty members in the 
Department of Computer Science at Queens College who have a joint appointment in the doctoral program. 
Students interested in doctoral studies should consult the PhD Program in Computer Science and CUNY Graduate 
Center websites for more information. The Accelerated Masters Degree program is available to qualified 
Queens College CS undergraduates.
