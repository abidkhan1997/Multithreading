PROJECT 1 PART 2 


Project Deliverables and Specification - Part 2 
-----------------------------------------------

In your first project part 2 you will use system calls to obtain and print to standard output the following information for each of  
the parent and child processes of Part 1. Your Part 2 source code is to be added to the source code of Part 1. Therefore, you will
submit one source code containing both Parts 1 and 2. You will also discuss Part 2 in your program write-up.  

1. pid of the process     

2. pid of the parent process

3. current working directory of the process

4. hostname of the process


You will also obtain and and print to standard output the following information about the Operating System (OS) at the start of
the parent process execution.

1. OS name     

2. OS release

3. OS version


Project Instructions - Part 2
-----------------------------

1) You will use the following system calls: gethostname(), getpid(), getppid(), getcwd(), and uname().

2) Refer to the instructions in the manual pages for the usage of the system calls in (1) above.

3) Use the output format as follows and replace the symbols in capital letters with their actual values obtained
   from the system calls:

 Process ID is:\t PROCESS_PID \n
 Parent process ID is:\t PARENT_PROCESS_PID \n
 Process current working directory is:\t CURRENT_WORKING_DIRECTORY \n
 Hostname is:\t HOSTNAME \n

 OS name is:\t OS_NAME \n
 OS release is:\t OS_RELEASE \n
 OS version is:\t OS_VERSION \n
